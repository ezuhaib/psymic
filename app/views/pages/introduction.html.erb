<h1 class="text-center">What is Psymic?</h1>
<p>Psymic is an online support group which on one hand supports its members, and on the other tries to build an exhaustive compilation of human behaviors.</p>

<h3><b>ONE:</b></br>A Global Behavioral Observations Compilation</h3>
<p>Human mind is so complex that despite significant advances in our understanding of human biology, our understanding of the mind is still lacking. This deficiency doesn't only arise from the mind's inherit complexity but also its unpredictability, person-to-person variability, and subtlety of its patterns.
Behavior and feeling are the two front-ends of mind. We cannot study the mind itself, because quite ironically we don't even know what it is. But behaviors and feelings are visible and usually understandable and serve as the only direct visualization of the enigmatic thing called mind. Studying these behaviors comprehensively, would therefore help us construct the most accurate profile of human mind possible. But isn't psychological science exactly that? Indeed. Except that it somewhat lacks what could lead to exponential growth in our understanding of the human mind: An exhaustive pool of observations and hypotheses from across the world, open for scientific scrutiny.</p>
<p>There are lots of non-psychologists who are able to track behavioral patterns in themselves and others with high fidelity. Their talents either gets consumed in creation of pop-psychology literature, self-help material or is used by themselves or others for manipulating people. These people could have contributed  a lot to a global pool of behavioral observations, and would greatly have helped psychology. But since there's no such pool, and no culture of valuing such observations, science has been missing a lot.</p>
<p>Psymic aims at creation of such global pool of behavioral observations, based on reports by keen observers, or those only sharing for coping, or those who analyze feelings and behaviors for coping (intellectualization). Secondly it asks the same people to analyze these reports, track patterns, make correlations and suggest solutions. While someone not trained to do so is otherwise labeled as a pop-psychologist, at Psymic pop-psychology isn't a taboo. Anything that works for most people and explains something well is valued. Although these analyses aren't scientifically as important as the behavioral reports, these do offer something in return to people sharing their observations, and may also greatly help in classifying and scrutinizing the same.</p>
<h3><b>TWO:</b></br>A purpose-built Support Group</h3>
<p>Sharing is considered one of the strongest healers of mind, second only to time. However, the chance to share is a privilege few enjoy. Some are crippled by their introversion or social phobias when it comes to sharing. Some actually don't have listening ears around them. Others need helping heads rather than mere listening ears, who actually suggest real non-clichéd solutions to their problems. In all of these cases, the best solution is establishment of support groups. However, there aren't many all over the world, neither in real, nor over the internet. Psymic aims to be a crowd-managed decentralized global support group, thereby granting the privilege to share to every single person on earth with access to internet, and the ability to communicate in languages supported at Psymic. Not only will Psymic bring to every person listening ears, but also non-clichéd answers to their problems.
