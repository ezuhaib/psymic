// Most js libraries are kept in vendors directory and are being used
// without help of gems. So any updates will have to be done manually.
// This shouldn't be an issue, except for bootstrap, because it's gem
// is still being used for sass assets, but not for js because we are
// using a minified version. Although bootstrap is currently locked at
// 3.1.1 ... in case it is decided to update it, the minified js should
// also be updated.
